### 2.3 Preliminary Analysis of the Rent Prices Data

**Variability in Rent Prices:**

The district of Les Corts shows the highest average monthly rent (Lloguer mitjà mensual) with a mean of €1235.72, and it also has the widest range of rent prices, with a standard deviation of €412.36.
Nou Barris presents as the district with the lowest average monthly rent at €583.03 and also has the lowest average rent per surface area (Lloguer mitjà per superfície), with a mean of €9.84 per square meter per month.

**Comparison:**

In districts like Ciutat Vella and Eixample, the average rent per surface area is relatively high, which could indicate that smaller apartments in these areas are priced at a premium compared to larger ones.
The average rent price per square meter (Lloguer mitjà per superfície) does not vary as widely as the total monthly rent, suggesting that the size of the apartments might be a significant factor in the total rent price differences among districts.

**High-End Districts:**

Sarrià-Sant Gervasi stands out with the highest average rent prices both monthly and per square meter, indicating it is one of the most expensive districts in Barcelona to live in.
    
**Affordability and Options:**

Horta-Guinardó offers a substantial number of rental options (40 entries for both rent types) with a lower average monthly rent, suggesting a balance between affordability and availability.
Nou Barris and Horta-Guinardó have lower variability in rent per square meter, indicating more uniformity in pricing within these districts compared to others.
    
**Middle Range Options:**

Gràcia and Sant Martí have a moderate average rent and a moderate number of entries, which could appeal to renters looking for a middle ground in terms of pricing and options.
    
**Outliers:**

From the box plot is easy to identify the outliers there are few and for the pourpose of this analysis this are not going to be removed.

### 2.4 Let's Map 2017 Rent Prices in Barcelona

- A very important step in analyzing the data is to visualize and understand the physical location where this data is coming from so let's create and map the rent prices data using folium

**For Plotting Maps Geo Dataset containing Neighborhoods Polygons of Barcelona is used**

Data/BarcelonaCiutat_Barris.csv

Source:https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/es/dataset/20170706-districtes-barris/resource/b21fa550-56ea-4f4c-9adc-b8009381896e?inner_spa

<img src="Images/12.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;">

- Next step is to select which dataset and which fields to use. For this study let's take the accident data set<br>
- First let's explore and pre process and clean the data.<br>


## 3 Merge Accident Dataset with Rent Prices ###     

- Study will focus into summarizing and bringing the average noise levels per Neighborhood and District occurred in Barcelona in 2017.<br>
- We will actually create two datasets since we have two pricing categories one is Average Rent Price per Month and the other one is Average price per m2
 
 **First we need to process Noise Data**
The noise data fields represent the percentage of people exposed to different noise ranges in the different neighborhoods in order to get an estimated average value of noise level per neighborhood we will do the folowing:

## 4 PCA

 - For PCA Analysis first we will need meaningful variables this two dataset we merged are not really well correlated since traffic accident data cannot me easily correlated to Rent Prices in all cases. At most it would have some relation to 
- We will actually create two datasets since we have two pricing categories one is Average Rent Price per Month and the other one is Average price per m2.

- The grey dots represent the neighborhoods projected onto the first two principal components.
- The red arrows represent the original variables (Preu and Estimated_Average_Noise_Level). The direction and length of the arrows indicate how each variable influences the principal components.

From the biplot, you can observe:

- Both variables seem to contribute similarly to the first principal component, as indicated by the arrows pointing roughly in the same direction.
- The second principal component captures variation orthogonal to the first, as seen by the difference in direction of the arrows.

## 5 Conclusions   

**Results:**
The scree plot shows the variance explained by each of the principal components. In our case, since there were only two features ('Preu' and 'Estimated_Average_Noise_Level') to start with, there are only two principal components.

The first principal component explains a significant portion of the variance in the data set. The exact percentage can be noted from the height of the first bar in the scree plot. This indicates that this principal component captures most of the information that was spread out over the original two features.

The second principal component, although explaining less variance than the first, still holds some level of information. Since we only started with two features, the second principal component will capture the remaining variance.

The cumulative explained variance line shows that by including both principal components, we retain the entirety of the information present in the original dataset.

**Interpretation:**

The dominance of the first principal component suggests that there is a strong pattern in the dataset where 'Preu' and 'Estimated_Average_Noise_Level' vary together to some extent. If the first principal component explains a large proportion of the variance (close to 100%), this would imply a strong linear relationship between the two original variables.

Given that the two original features are 'Preu' (price) and 'Estimated_Average_Noise_Level', the first principal component could be interpreted as an index of 'cost of living' or 'rental desirability', assuming that noise level is an important factor in rental prices.

The second principal component would then capture variations in the data that are orthogonal (independent) to the first component. If the first component represents a 'cost of living' index, the second could represent variations that are independent of this index, perhaps related to aspects of the neighborhood that are not captured by price and noise level alone.

Despite the PCA suggesting that these two variables contribute similarly to the first principal component, the actual linear relationship between them is not strong, according to the correlation coefficient. This result suggests that other factors may be influencing the variation captured by the first principal component, or that the relationship between rent price and noise level is not linear and may be more complex.

This two datasets are together do not provide great correlation to fruther analyze price rent increase in Barcelona during 20217, even there might be some relationship to noise levels in the neighborhoods many other factors are to be taking into account to perform throuhgt study.

**Analysis**
    
- From the distribution and mainly from the maps is easy to understand the locations with most accidents and is as expected on the roads with more traffic is where the most accidents happened.
    
- Further analysis can be done with this dataset alone from accident evolution to clustering to determine hot spots.
